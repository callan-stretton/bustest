# Where's my Bus?

A bus location tracking app that grabs real-time API data from Metlink and shows you where on a map your bus is, how many minutes late it is running, and whether you would still be able to make it to the bus stop in time if you left now.

## Instructions: 

1. Preparation
- Clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/callan-stretton/bustest```
- Run ```npm i```
- Run ```npm start```
- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

2. Select the bus or train service you would like from the dropdown

3. Toggle between showing the inbound and outbound services

4. Hover over the service to see whether it's running late or if it's on time

## In development 

- ~~First Deployment~~
- Make mobile friendly
- Second Deployment
- More bus services
- Locate the user
- Determining how long it would take you to get from your position to your bus stop
- Simulate smooth bus-path positions as the data is only pinged every 30 seconds
